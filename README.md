# lights_off
A small puzzle game that was inspired by a 3d physical connect 4 board, that had a game mode on it, where you would press the button and turn off or on the light you pressed and the surrounding lights. 

It's a 5x5 board. where your goal is to turn off the lights, when you select a light the surrounding lights (up, down, left and right) will toggle on or off.
